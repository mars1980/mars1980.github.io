        <h3>Sketchbook/Journal:</h3>
        <h4>Weekly</h4>
        <p>Using research, direct observation, and artistic experimentation -  examine, interrogate and intervene on a
         specific place that is a common/daily part of your life. Use whatever methodologies are most comfortable to you: programming, drawing, writing,
         sound recording, etc. Also, as your practice progress, take on experimental forms of mapping, describing, and disrupting that space. The space is up to you
         but should be a specific, definable, and a space that you engage with regularly. 
         <blockquote><strong>Ex:</strong> Examining your subway commute: issues of personal space? Why are the chairs a certain way? Designed from spatial perspective or behavioral perspective? How does having poles in certain places change how people act? What are the spatial politics of these spaces?
        What mechanisms of power are being hidden, subverted, or enforced?</blockquote> </p>

        <p>We will discuss findings weekly as a way to chart the development of our practice.</p>
        <h3>Psychogeographical Map:</h3>
        <h4>Due: 2.23.15</h4>
        <p>Take a self quantified Drift. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9rive" target="blank">Drift</a> (unplanned/spontaneous walk) can be either a series of shorter unplanned walks or it can be a single long endurance event. Using some form of biofeedback (could be GPS paired with heart rate monitor or drawings on paper), chart your emotional or pscyhological reactions to the spaces you encounter. Post the map and an analysis of the experience on your blog and be prepared to discuss in class. Some <a href="http://biomapping.net/"> Inspiration.</a></p>
