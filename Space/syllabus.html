        <h2>Class Policies</h2>
        <h6>Grading</h6>
       Grading will be based on the following:
            <ul>
                <li>Regular Assignments: 30%</li>
                <li>Final Project: 30%</li>
                <li>Participation and Attendance: 40%</li>
            </ul>
        <p><strong>**Please </strong>let me know ahead of time if you would like me to give you a letter grade. Otherwise, Please see ITP's statement on <a href="http://help.itp.nyu.edu/academic-policies/pass-fail">Pass/Fail</a> which states that a "Pass" is equivalent to an "A" or a "B" while anything less would be considered a "Fail".</p>
        <h6>Attendance</h6>
        <p>Attendance to the class is mandatory. Please email me if you need to miss a class or are going to be late. Habitual latness or missing classes will result in a lower grade.</p>

   
        <h6>Class Participation</h6>
        <p>This class will be heavily discussion based and your participation will make it awesome. Discussions will center around class readings as well as outside material. Please be prepared to discuss weekly readings. Since this is a class about 'space', I'll try to get us off the Floor as much as possible. Please be prepared to make efforts for offsite class meetings.</p>

        <h6>Regular Assignments:</h6>
        <p>There will be 3 short 'experiments' before the Final Project. Each assignment is meant to act as a sort of sketch, to point toward a larger body of work or project. There will be 3 regular assignments that will last about a week each. There are no specific medium requirements, but experimentation is encouraged!</p>

        <h6>Final Projects</h6>
        <p>Final Projects can be a continuation of one of the previous shorter assignments or can be all together something new. The final assigment should critically examine and disrupt 'space' as we've come to understand it in the class. This will be a 4 week project, and deliverables could include flushed out large scale project proposals with in situ documentation, a series of progressive experiments or body of work, or a singular project/intervention. </p>

        <h6>Blog</h6>
        <p>Like most classes at ITP, blogging is crucial to documentation of process as well as proof of deliverables. Please create either a dedicated blog for the class or a category / tag. Your blog for this class will serve as a sketchbook of sorts, a way to chart you understanding of and experiments with space. </p>

        <h6>Laptop / Social Media Policy</h6>
        <p>Laptops will be allowed for access to readings and class related discussion. However, they can also be really distracting (for you and your neighbor). Please, no Gmail, Facebook, Instagram, texting, etc. during class time. Laptops are to be closed during guest lectures and class critiques. </p>
