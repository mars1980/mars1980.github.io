        <h2>Course Description</h2>
        <p><q>Space</q>, whether physical, virtual, or imagined, is the result of a feedback loop between actors, objects, and their environment.  As we shape the world, so the world shapes us. These complex and shifting relationships are far from neutral and are embedded with social norms, assumptions, and rules of engagement.  How do we engage with these norms and beyond that, how do we deconstruct and redefine a new spatial practice? How can we reshape ourselves and the world around us, consciously and intentionally?</p>

        <p>This 12-week class will examine the social production of space as understood by Marxist and Post War French thinkers. Students will engage with a spatial practice through reading assignments, class discussion, guest speakers, and hands on experimental mapping and social hacking.  We will be reading the writings of Marx, Lefebvre, Foucault, Hakim Bey, Baudrillard, and looking at the work of Trevor Paglan, Francis Alys, Fallen Fruit, Natalie Jeremijenko, Michael Rakowitz, and The Center for Urban Progress.  </p>

        <p>The topic of <q>Space</q> will be examined from 3 angles: public, private, and virtual. The semester will be broken into 2 parts. The first half of the semester, students will begin to engage with spatial practice with shorter exercises designed to deconstruct these three types of space. These assignments could include creating a sound map of an <q>Othered</q> space such as a local superfund site, a seedy motel room, or Eastern Parkway during Kaporos. Another might be taking weekly unplanned meandering walks and creating a heat map of emotional responses. A third might be creating an artist residency in a 3D Gaming Engine or online social media platform.  The medium will be the student's choice, and can range from performance to Processing to pen and paper. 
        </p>
        <p>
        The last half of the class will progress toward a student-driven final project.  Students will investigate a socially and historically specific space, culminating in a direct intervention or <q>social hack</q>. Examples of this kind of work include the organization Islands of LA, Krzysztof Wodiczkos homeless vehicle, and Micha Cardenas Second Life performance.
